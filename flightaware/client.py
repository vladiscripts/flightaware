        SetAlert creates or updates a FlightXML flight alert. When the alert is
        triggered, a callback mechanism will be used to notify the address
        specified by RegisterAlertEndpoint. Each alert that is triggered is
        charged at the rate of one "class 2" FlightXML query.

        If the "alert_id" argument is specified, then an existing alert is
        updated to the new values specified, otherwise a 0 or blank alert_id
        will cause a new alert to be created.

        As a special case, if "alert_id" is specified as -1 and "ident" is not
        blank, update the most recently modified alert for the same "ident" to
        the arguments specified. If no existing alert for that "ident" exists,
        create it.

        For a single day alert, specify date_start and date_end with the same
        value. For a recurring alert, specify both date_start as 0 and date_end
        as 0.

        The "channel" argument is a Tcl-style string list that specifies the
        target channel ID and the triggering event types. At this time, the
        channel ID should always be specified as 16. Supported event types are:
        e_filed e_departure e_arrival e_diverted e_cancelled. For example this
        specifies a FlightXML Push channel with several flight statuses:
        "{16 e_filed e_departure e_arrival e_diverted e_cancelled}"

        The "max_weekly" argument is used to prevent the an alert from being
        created that might generate more alerts than desired. This check is
        only done at alert creation time based on historical trends for the
        filter selection, and is not an enforcement of alerts actually
        delivered.

        Returns a non-zero number (the alert_id that was added or updated) on
        success, otherwise an exception is raised. An error string beginning
        with "OVERLIMIT" means the user has exceeded the maximum number of
        enabled alerts permitted by their account type; consider disabling or
        deleting some alerts, or request an account upgrade. An error string
        beginning with "FLOODWARN" means that the new alert was rejected
        because it was predicted to exceed the number of alerts specified by
        the "max_weekly" argument.

        SetMaximumResultSize modifies the maximum result count returned by other FlightXML methods. Many FlightXML methods that return lists limit the number of results to 15 records for performance reasons, even if you specify a larger number to its "howMany" argument. Using this method, you can raise the limit allowed for the "howMany" argument for all subsequent FlightXML methods invoked using your account. Once invoked, the last specified max_size is remembered for your account until the next call to SetMaximumResultSize; it is not necessary to call this function repeatedly.

        Any request that has a "howMany" argument and returns more than 15 records will be billed at a rate equivalent to the actual number of results returned divided by 15, rounded up. For example, if you call SetMaximumResultSize with a max_size of 100, then call FlightInfo with howMany of 45, but it only returns 35 records, you will be charged the equivalent of calling FlightInfo a total of 3 times, or 1+int(35/15).
