        SearchBirdseyePositions performs a query for aircraft flightpath datapoints matching the search query. This allows you to locate flights that have ever flown within a specific a latitude/longitude box, groundspeed, and altitude. It takes search terms in a single string comprising of {operator key value} elements and returns an array of flight structures. Each search term must be enclosed in curly braces. Multiple search terms can be combined in an implicit boolean "and" by separating the terms with at least one space. This function only searches flight data representing approximately the last 24 hours.

        The supported operators include (note that operators take different numbers of arguments):

        false — results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of false. Example: {false preferred}
        true — results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of true. Example: {true preferred}
        null — results must have the specified key set to a null value. Example: {null waypoints}
        notnull — results must have the specified key not set to a null value. Example: {notnull aircraftType}
        = — results must have a key that exactly matches the specified value. Example: {= fp C172}
        != — results must have a key that must not match the specified value. Example: {!= prefix H}
        < — results must have a key that is lexicographically less-than a specified value. Example: {< arrivalTime 1276811040}
        > — results must have a key that is lexicographically greater-than a specified value. Example: {> circles 5}
        <= — results must have a key that is lexicographically less-than-or-equal-to a specified value. Example: {<= alt 8000}
        >= — results must have a key that is lexicographically greater-than-or-equal-to a specified value.
        match — results must have a key that matches against a case-insensitive wildcard pattern. Example: {match ident COA*}
        notmatch — results must have a key that does not match against a case-insensitive wildcard pattern. Example: {notmatch aircraftType B76*}
        range — results must have a key that is numerically between the two specified values. Example: {range alt 8000 20000}
        in — results must have a key that exactly matches one of the specified values. Example: {in orig {KLAX KBUR KSNA KLGB}}
        The supported key names include (note that not all of these key names are returned in the result structure, and some have slightly different names):

        alt — Altitude, measured in hundreds of feet or Flight Level.
        altChar — a one-character code indicating the change in altitude.
        altMax — Altitude, measured in hundreds of feet or Flight Level.
        cid — a three-character cid code
        cidfac — a four-character cidfac code
        clock — UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
        facility — a four-character facility code
        fp — unique identifier assigned by FlightAware for this flight, aka faFlightID.
        gs — ground speed, measured in kts.
        lat — latitude of the reported position.
        lon — longitude of the reported position
        preferred — boolean indicator of position quality
        recvd — UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970

        SetAlert creates or updates a FlightXML flight alert. When the alert is
        triggered, a callback mechanism will be used to notify the address
        specified by RegisterAlertEndpoint. Each alert that is triggered is
        charged at the rate of one "class 2" FlightXML query.

        If the "alert_id" argument is specified, then an existing alert is
        updated to the new values specified, otherwise a 0 or blank alert_id
        will cause a new alert to be created.

        As a special case, if "alert_id" is specified as -1 and "ident" is not
        blank, update the most recently modified alert for the same "ident" to
        the arguments specified. If no existing alert for that "ident" exists,
        create it.

        For a single day alert, specify date_start and date_end with the same
        value. For a recurring alert, specify both date_start as 0 and date_end
        as 0.

        The "channel" argument is a Tcl-style string list that specifies the
        target channel ID and the triggering event types. At this time, the
        channel ID should always be specified as 16. Supported event types are:
        e_filed e_departure e_arrival e_diverted e_cancelled. For example this
        specifies a FlightXML Push channel with several flight statuses:
        "{16 e_filed e_departure e_arrival e_diverted e_cancelled}"

        The "max_weekly" argument is used to prevent the an alert from being
        created that might generate more alerts than desired. This check is
        only done at alert creation time based on historical trends for the
        filter selection, and is not an enforcement of alerts actually
        delivered.

        Returns a non-zero number (the alert_id that was added or updated) on
        success, otherwise an exception is raised. An error string beginning
        with "OVERLIMIT" means the user has exceeded the maximum number of
        enabled alerts permitted by their account type; consider disabling or
        deleting some alerts, or request an account upgrade. An error string
        beginning with "FLOODWARN" means that the new alert was rejected
        because it was predicted to exceed the number of alerts specified by
        the "max_weekly" argument.

Using this method, you can raise the limit allowed for the "howMany" argument for all subsequent FlightXML methods invoked using your account. Once invoked, the last specified max_size is remembered for your account until the next call to SetMaximumResultSize; it is not necessary to call this function repeatedly.
